# Deprecated

This Ansible Galaxy role is now deprecated in favor of the new Ansible collection.
Please use the Ansible collection instead: https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pan-os-ansible.

# Palo Alto Networks Ansible modules

A collection of Ansible modules that automate configuration and
operational tasks on Palo Alto Networks Next Generation Firewalls --
both physical and virtualized form factor. The underlying protocol uses
API calls that are wrapped within the Ansible framework.

## Role / Collection Compatibility

The Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS Ansible modules were previously distributed as an
Ansible Galaxy role (<https://galaxy.ansible.com/paloaltonetworks/paloaltonetworks>).
Since Ansible 2.9, RedHat has urged developers to migrate to `collections` to
organize and distribute their integrations.  The new collection can be found here:
<https://galaxy.ansible.com/paloaltonetworks/panos>

The 1.0 version of this collection is a straight port of the Ansible Galaxy
role v2.4.0.  If you are using Ansible 2.9 or later and you are using the
role, then you can safely use this instead with no change in functionality.  Just
specify the `collections` spec, remove
`PaloAltoNetworks.paloaltonetworks` from the `roles` spec, and you're done!

Now that the collection is live, **no new features will be added to the role**.  All
active development will take place on the collection moving forwared.  Users are
encouraged to upgrade to Ansible 2.9 and start using the new collection to stay
up-to-date with features and bug fixes.

## Installation

The recommended way to install the modules is installing the Palo Alto
Networks Ansible Galaxy role:

```
