# FILENAME
# basic_networking_config.yml
#
# DESCRIPTION
# Example playbook that will configure basic networking and set default password for the admin user. In particular this
# script will:
# - update admin password with new password using SSH
# - create layer 3 trust and untrust zones
# - configure eth1/1 with DHCP and add it to untrust zone
# - configure eth1/2 with DHCP and add it to trust zone
# - set primary DNS server to Google's 8.8.8.8
# - set NTP servers to 0.us.pool.ntp.org and 1.us.pool.ntp.org
#
# The first call uses SSH protocol with private key. This is a typical example of what user has to do in order to
# provision FW in AWS.
#
# REQUIREMENTS
# pip install ansible
# ansible-galaxy install PaloAltoNetworks.paloaltonetworks
#
# STEPS
# update vars.yml with your own credentials/settings
#
# Good practice: The var files are provided in cleartext. They should be edited and encrypred using:
# ansible-vault encrypt firewall-secrets.yml 
#
# EXECUTE
# ansible-playbook basic_networking_config.yml
