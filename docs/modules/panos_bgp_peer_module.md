_(versionadded:: 2.9)_


## Synopsis

PanOS module for configuring a BGP Peer in a peer group.


## Requirements (on host that executes module)

- pandevice can be obtained from PyPI https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandevice

| username | str |  | admin |  | Username credentials to use for auth unless I(api_key) is set |
| password | str |  |  |  | Password credentials to use for auth unless I(api_key) is set |
| api_key | str |  |  |  | API key that can be used instead of I(username)/I(password) credentials |
