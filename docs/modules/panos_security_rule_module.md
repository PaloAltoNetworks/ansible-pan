# panos_security_rule

_(versionadded:: 2.4)_


## Synopsis

Security policies allow you to enforce rules and take action, and can be as general or specific as needed.
The policy rules are compared against the incoming traffic in sequence, and because the first rule that matches
the traffic is applied, the more specific rules must precede the more general ones.


## Requirements (on host that executes module)

- pandevice can be obtained from PyPi https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandevice

| disable_server_response_inspection |  |  |  | Disables packet inspection from the server to the client. Useful under heavy server load conditions. |

| group_profile |  | None |  | - Security profile group that is already defined in the system. This property supersedes antivirus, vulnerability, spyware, url_filtering, file_blocking, data_filtering, and wildfire_analysis properties.
 |
| hip_profiles |  | any |  | - If you are using GlobalProtect with host information profile (HIP) enabled, you can also base the policy on information collected by GlobalProtect. For example, the user access level can be determined HIP that notifies the firewall about the user's local configuration.
